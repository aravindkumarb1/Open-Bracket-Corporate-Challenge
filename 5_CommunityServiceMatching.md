##Challenge #5: Community Service Matching (Accelerate Delaware)


**Solve For:** Matching low cost or pro bono service provider hours with in-need small businesses


**Example Solution Direction:** Create a marketplace tool where service providers can offer hours and small businesses can request and then make recommendations based on preferences.


**Use-Case Overview:** Today's local businesses are in constant need of supportive services such a marketing, legal and creative to keep pace with the competition. Many times, these services are needed only in a limited capacity or even one-offâ€™s, therefore, making large service provider firms fiscally excessive and out of reach. This leaves a vacancy in which services are still needed but the demand is not met. The void between the local business community and the services they need allows for young local talent to emerge and help fill the gap. The challenge is to create a solution that will connect young professional with local businesses that are in need of specialized talent and services. This application should allow young professionals to display their talents and areas of expertise to local businesses in an accessible and meaningful way. Local businesses should be able to quickly and easily taget the best professionals to fulfill their service needs. Overall this application should connect local businesses and young emerging professionals in a way that is easy, efficient and relevant for all parties.
